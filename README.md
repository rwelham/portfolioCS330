## How do I approach designing and developing software?

My approach to designing software starts with looking at all of the requirements and gathering extra information on them should I need more from the client. After getting all of the requirements, I break them down into different pieces that can be worked on and integrated with testing as I go along. For this project, I followed a similar route. First was creating the different shapes that needed to be a part of the scene. This then moved to creating the camera controls before moving into textures and lighting. After each part was updated, tests were run to make sure the scene worked with each new part and adjustments could be made as needed. This works will with the Agile approach to developing software as it include breaking down a large project, working on it incrementally, and multiple phases of testing to ensure that the pieces coming together didn't break each other. 


## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My goals in learning about and completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science depend on having a wide toolkit of different techniques and processes. Even if I don't further use computational graphics and visualizations, knowing how they work and how to puzzle through them can help with projects in the future. A lot of Computer Science is rapidly changing and evolving which makes it so having a wide variety of knowledge can make me more adaptable to any changes. Further, having an understanding of how to use computational graphics and visualizations can be used to add to projects that might need a visual interface. Many programs need to have user friendly interfaces and knowing how to put together a good scene can help with this in other places.
